**Molecular Models of Woody Biochars**

Models of biochars, representative of woody biochar produced at low (400ºC), medium (600ºC) and high (800ºC) highest treatment temperatures: `BC400`, `BC600`, `BC800`, respectively.

Each directory contains a bulk model `BCxxx_BULK.gro`, a surface-exposed model `BCxxx_SURF.gro`, with asigned OPLS-AA forcefield as `BCxxx.top` to be used with both systems. 

We also include OPLS-AA forcefield directory, as included in GROMACS molecular simulationn package.

See Wood et al., 2023 for details.
