**Molecular Models of Woody Biochars**

Models of biochars, representative of woody biochar produced at low (400ºC), medium (600ºC) and high (800ºC) highest treatment temperatures: `BC400`, `BC600`, `BC800`, respectively.

Each directory contains a bulk model, a surface-exposed model, with asigned OPLS-AA forcefield. 

We also include OPLS-AA forcefield directory, as included in GROMACS molecular simulationn package.

See Wood et al., 2023 for details.
