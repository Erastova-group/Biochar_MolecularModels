**Biochar Molecular Models**


`data/` 

Data used for model development in `.csv` format plus plotted data in `.pdf` format.



`building_blocks/`

Molecular building blocks used throughout our model development as both `.mol` and `.pdb` files, 
plus `.csv` file containing the chemical information of these building blocks.

In our simulations we used used OPLS-AA force field.
To generate a topology files, please follow instructions on http://zarbi.chem.yale.edu/ligpargen and http://polypargen.com.



`models/`

Molecular models of woody biochars produced at low (400ºC), medium (600ºC) and high (800ºC) highest treatment temperatures (see Wood et al. 2023 for details).

All files needed for simulation with GROMACs are included, plus a copy of the OPLS-AA 2001 forcefield.
