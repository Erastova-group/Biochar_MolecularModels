**Biochar Molecular Models**

By Rosie Wood (rosie.wood@ed.ac.uk) and Valentina Erastova (valentina.erastova@ed.ac.uk)

---

`data/` 

Data used for model development in `.csv` format, plus plotted data in `.pdf` format.

----

`building_blocks/`

Molecular building blocks used throughout our model development as both `.mol` and `.pdb` files,\
plus `.csv` file containing the chemical information of these building blocks.

In our simulations we used used OPLS-AA force field.\
To generate a topology files, please follow instructions on http://zarbi.chem.yale.edu/ligpargen and http://polypargen.com.

----

`models/`

Molecular models of bulk and surface-exposed woody biochars produced at low (400ºC), medium (600ºC) and high (800ºC) highest treatment temperatures (see Wood et al. 2023 for details).

All files needed for simulation with GROMACs are included.
