`data/` 

Data used for model development in .csv format plus plotted data in .pdf format.

`building_blocks/`

Molecular building blocks used throughout our model development as both .mol and .pdb files plus a .csv file containing the chemical information of these building blocks.

To generate OPLS_AA topology files for these, please follow instructions on http://zarbi.chem.yale.edu/ligpargen and http://polypargen.com.

`models/`

Molecular models of woody biochars produced at low (400ºC), medium (600ºC) and high (800ºC) highest treatment temperatures as detailed in Wood et al. 2023. 

All files needed for simulation with GROMACs are included, plus a copy of the OPLS-AA 2001 forcefield.
